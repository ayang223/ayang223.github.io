					<h3>United Way Dashboard</h3>
					<h4>Dashboard application for visualizing data</h4></button>
					<div class='col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3 text-left content'>
						<p>
							Developed a web app for United Way that allows users to upload .CSV files onto a database. The data can then be queried through the front end client and presented visually for analytics.
						</p>
						<p>
							My role in this project was that I was responsible for establishing the connection in which the front-end communicated with the back-end. I also created the Admin page which included the functions for creating and deleting users. In addition, I was also responsible for dynamically populating the filter drop down menu with fields that were from the .CSV files as well as the function for filtering out unwanted data.

					<div class='col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3 text-left content'>
						<p>
							A web-scrapper made for nwHacks 2018. What this web-scrapper does is when a user enters an item into the search, it looks through various sites such as Amazon, Kijiji, and Craigslist and returns which site has the cheapest item, as well as the min/max and average price. I was responsible for creating the functions that searched through kijiji
						</p>
						<p>
							The reason my team decided to do this as a hackathon submission was that none of us knew how to use python and decided it was a good opportunity to learn a new language.

							Tools used:
							<ul>
								<li>Python</li>

					<h4>Lumohack 2017 submission</h4></button>
					<div class='col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3 text-left content'>
						<p>
							Lumohack is a hackathon related to health so my team developed a pomodoro timer to help remind students to take breaks while studying. What differentiates this pomodoro timer with others is this one has a social aspect to it which allow users to chat and meet up with other nearby users who are studying. The main function I was in charge with for this app was the basic functions and design of the clock and timer.

						<p>
							Continuing from what I've learned from nwHacks, I developed a python script that monitors a webpage and sends notifcation to your phone using the Pushbullet API.
							The initial intention for developing this was to help my friend be notified when there is an available spot for a course.

							Using a spiral design cycle, a paper prototype was developed and then tested during a walk-through. After the walk-through, problems that were found were then fixed moving onto the medium fidelity prototype. A field test was then conducted with the medium fidelity prototype.
